              Having worked directly with these organizations as consulting
              clients, MediRate’s leadership is aware of the complexity involved
              in finding and tracking Medicaid payment rates and the frustration
              created by unexpected reimbursement changes. Our goal is to improve
              Medicaid payment rate transparency and support strategic
              decision-making by provider organizations and other stakeholders.
